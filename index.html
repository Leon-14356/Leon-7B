    <h1> The History of the Champions League </h1> 
    <p> The Champions League was founded in 1955 by UEFA (Union of European Footbaut as of 2025,
    <br> the team that has won the Champions League the most is a team called Real Madrid (which is a very big club in Spain)and they have won 15 Champions Leagues'.
    <br> In football the only way to qualify for the Champions League is to place within the top 4 but these four spots in the Champions League
    <br> are only for the big league's like La Liga ( the league in Spain),Premier League ( the league in England) and the Bundesliga ( League in Germany). 
    <br> The smaller leagues like the Eredivisie (the dutch league) only have 2 Champions League spots so your team has to work really hard in order to qualify. 
    <h2>How to win the Champions League</h2>
    <div align="center">

    </div>
    <style>
 p{ color:rgb(7, 63, 109); }
    </style>
    <br> There are 36 spots in the Champions League currently and only 24 qualify to the next round which is the knockout round
    <br> (From this point onwards, teams have to play two matches to decide who wins)and then they go to the Quarter finals and after they win that they go to the semi finals and 
    <br> then after they win the semi finals they go to the finals.
    <br> Now since its the finals, you don't have to play 2 matches to decide who wins and only need to play 1 match to see who wins. When a team beats another team in the Champions League final they get to lift the trophy
    <br> but the team captain gets to hold it first. It's great to lift the trophy but you need to work <b>hard</b> to earn it and only the <b>best players in Europe</b> are able to achieve this. Here is a list of some of the
    <br> best players who won the Champions League.
    <br> <ul><li>Lionel Messi</li><li>Cristiano Ronaldo</li><li>Ronaldinho</li><li>Sergio Ramos</li><li>Erling Haaland</li><li>Mohamed Salah</li></ul>
    <br> Now these players we just talked about are some of the best players who have won the Champions League,so let's talk about who won it last and what the Champions League table
    <br> looked like before going into the playoffs. But first let's show the table, so that we know what type of teams are good and what type of teams aren't the best.

    </table>
    <br> At the top of the table we can see that Liverpool only lost one game and therefore came first but at the bottom we have Young Boys who didn't do so well lost all their games and played very badly overall.
    <br> Although Liverpool came first in the table they couldn't continue their form and lost to PSG in the round of 16. Whilst looking through the table you may have realised that there are 
    <br>a couple of teams that have the same points but are either lower or higher in placement.This is because of the amount of goals they have conceded or scored and therefore relates
    <br>to the placement you get. So not only do you have to win your games, but you have to make sure you score a lot of goals to secure your place in one of the 24 spots available to 
    <br>go to the playoffs of the Champions League which can be very hard to do if your team is not good.Previously, I named players who won the Champions League but there are way more players 
    <br>who won it and some even won it multiple times but I only named 6 players who very famously won it.The Champions League is known as one of the<em><b>hardest</b></em> and <em><b>best</b></em> 
    <br>trophies in Europe because all the teams in Europe play against each other and contest for the trophy and once you win it, you can officially be crowned the<em><b>"Champions of Europe"</b></em>, 
    <br>Many people wish to be called that as it highlights that no team in Europe could beat you and that you topped all of them and lifted the trophy.
    <h3>The Champions League Trophy</h3>
    <div align="center">
    <img src= "Champions League.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="A shiny trophy">
    </div>
    <br> We have covered a lot of how the Champions League works and some of the history but now we are going to talk about the actual trophy.
    <br> The Champions League trophy has two types of trophies. The trophy that players get to lift and celebrate is the replacement trophy which is made of sterling silver and is 73.5cm tall and weighs 7.5kg and has a <em><b>monetary 
    <br> value</b></em> estimated to be worth <em><b>BHD 5,650</b></em> or if your in america that is $15,000. The actual trophy of the champions league although, is estimated to be 1.62 metres tall and roughly 
    <br> weighs 45kg. But the truly extraordinarily and fascinating fact about the Champions League is that it is worth a whoppin <em><b>$1.3 million!</b></em>. Even though the Champions League trophy is the silverware that everyone
    <br> wants to win, it's not the only thing you can win as their is also a gold medal for winning it as well(made of a partial amount of gold). The Champions League medal consists of sterling 
    <br>silver and is also made up of many metal alloys but it's appearance shows as gold as it has a limited amount of it which covers the medal. 
    <br>The medal in the Champions League can be seen as a little brother to the big silver trophy that every team wants to win  so not many people recognise it as it isn't as big or noticeable.
