    <h1> The History of the Champions League </h1>
    <img src= "Champions League.jpg" alt="A shiny trophy">
    <p> The Champions League was founded in 1955 by UEFA (Union of European Football Associations).
    <br> In the past years many teams in football have won the Champions League but as of 2025,
    <br> the team that has won the Champions League the most is a team called Real Madrid (which is a very big club in Spain).
    <br> In football the only way to qualify for the Champions League is to place within the top 4 but these four spots in the Champions League
    <br> are only for the big league's like La Liga ( the league in Spain),Premier League ( the league in England) and many more.
    <br> The smaller leagues like the Eredivisie (the dutch league) only have 2 Champions League spots so your team has to work really hard in order to qualify.

    <br> There are 36 spots in the Champions League currently and only 24 qualify to the next round which is the knockout round. From this point onwards, teams have to play two matches to decide who wins.
    <br> After the knockout out round, is the round of 16 and then after that, is the quarter finals. Then the teams who won go to the semi finals and then after they win the semi finals they go to the finals.
    <br> Now since its the finals, you don't have to play 2 matches to decide who wins and only need to play 1 match to see who wins. When a team beats another team in the Champions League they get to lift the trophy
    <br> but the team captain gets to hold it first.
