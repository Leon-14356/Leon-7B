    <h1> The History of the Champions League </h1>ll Associations).
    <br> In the past years many teams in football have won the Champions League 
    <img src= "Champions League.jpg" alt="A shiny trophy">
    <p> The Champions League was founded in 1955 by UEFA (Union of European Footbaut as of 2025,
    <br> the team that has won the Champions League the most is a team called Real Madrid (which is a very big club in Spain)and they have won 15 Champions Leagues'.
    <br> In football the only way to qualify for the Champions League is to place within the top 4 but these four spots in the Champions League
    <br> are only for the big league's like La Liga ( the league in Spain),Premier League ( the league in England) and the Bundesliga ( League in Germany). 
    <br> The smaller leagues like the Eredivisie (the dutch league) only have 2 Champions League spots so your team has to work really hard in order to qualify. 
    <h2>How to win the Champions League</h2>
    <br> There are 36 spots in the Champions League currently and only 24 qualify to the next round which is the knockout round
    <br> (From this point onwards, teams have to play two matches to decide who wins)and then they go to the Quarter finals and after they win that they go to the semi finals and 
    <br> then after they win the semi finals they go to the finals.
    <br> Now since its the finals, you don't have to play 2 matches to decide who wins and only need to play 1 match to see who wins. When a team beats another team in the Champions League final they get to lift the trophy
    <br> but the team captain gets to hold it first. It's great to lift the trophy but you need to work <b>hard</b> to earn it and only the <b>best players in Europe</b> are able to achieve this. Here is a list of some of the
    <br> who won the Champions League.
    <br> <ul><li>Lionel Messi</li><li>Cristiano Ronaldo</li><li>Ronaldinho</li><li>Sergio Ramos</li><li>Erling Haaland</li><li>Mohamed Salah</li></ul>
    
    <br> There are many more players who won it and some even won it multiple times but I only named 6 players who very famously won it. The Champions League is known as one of the 
    <br> hardest and best trophies in Europe because all the teams in Europe play against each other and contest for the trophy and once you win it, you can officially be crowned the
    <br> "Champions of Europe". Many people wish to be called that as it highlights that no team in Europe could beat you and that you topped all of them and lifted the trophy.
