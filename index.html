    <h1> The History of the Champions League </h1>
    <img src= "Champions League.jpg" alt="A shiny trophy">
    <p> The Champions League was founded in 1955 by UEFA (Union of European Football Associations).
    <br> In the past years many teams in football have won the Champions League but as of 2025,
    <br> the team that has won the Champions League the most is a team called Real Madrid (which is a very big club in Spain).
    <br> In football the only way to qualify for the Champions League is to place within the top 4 but these four spots in the Champions League
    <br> are only for the big league's like La Liga ( the league in Spain),Premier League ( the league in England) and many more.
    <br> The smaller leagues like the swiss league only have 1 Champions League spot so your team has to work really hard in order to qualify.
